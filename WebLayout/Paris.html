              <h1>Paris</h1>
              <p>Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,165,423 residents in 2019 in an area of more than 105 km² (41 sq mi),[4] making it the 34th most densely populated city in the world in 2020.[5] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, and science. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its very early system of street lighting, in the 19th century it became known as "the City of Light".[6] Like London, prior to the Second World War, it was also sometimes called the capital of the world.</p>
